### Questionaires

1. I spent about ~5 hours on this assignment.
2. What I like about my implementation is data and state is managed by one component (GanttChart) all other ones are simple functional components for displaying UI. I also wrote TimelineRow class to help construct most efficient timeline row.
3. If I were to do this again, I would first read about how other people have built charts especially timeline charts via tech blogs, youtubes and learn from their learnings and mistakes. Aligning date labels with timeline row items took longer than expected and I am pretty sure many people ran into the same problem.
4. I Googled Gantt charts for an example and took a very simple design and used it as a motivation. The main different is Gantt chart has a single item per row but here we actually want many items per row as possible to build heigh efficient chart.
5. If I had more time, I would have implemented a way to add and delete functionalites so I can see timeline updating each time. It would have been really cool to add a simple animation on top of it too.
